## 🔗 Deployed Smart Contract

- Network: Edu Chain  
- Contract Address: 0xE6959a4531145d52B04d40cf7B621768cDF024D3

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Update Engagement:  
   - Admin updates user engagement scores via updateEngagement(address user, uint256 score).  

2. Check Scores & Rewards:  
   - getEngagement(address user) → View engagement points.  
   - getRewards(address user) → View total earned rewards.  

3. Claim Rewards:  
   - Users with 100+ points can claim rewards using claimReward().  
   - Engagement resets after claiming.
